## Done

- [x] Doxygen depends on source and header files
    - [x] Centralize sources and objects instead of test_sources and main_sources so on (depending on make variable given) (this could make makefile simpler and make it easier to implement doxygen which depends on sources and headers where i wonâ€™t need to create multiple doxygen targets for different scenarios. One with dynamic variable will suffice)
- [x] Add homebrew gcc version to README
- [x] LICENCE
- [x] System SDL2 installation
- [x] TODO
- [x] gcc -std=cXX (specify C standard)
